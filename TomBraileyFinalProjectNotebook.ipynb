    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing political risk is essential for a host of diverse actors. From investors, to holidaymakers, to think tanks, being able to effectively ascertain the varying forms and levels of political risk across time and location helps to form actors' strategies when making important decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, the data that do exist are sparse and often not interpretable to the layperson. While various think tanks and political risk firms (such as Eurasia Group, The PRS Group, and the World Bank) release yearly reports on political risk, the raw data is often not readily useable, and may not be applicable to one's interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I have designed a minimum viable product of a Geopolitical Risk Interactive Database (GRID), which takes raw data from The PRS Group, cleans it, then allows users to subset and generate graphs and statistical analyses based on their chosen subsets. This product will prove useful for academics, investors, and anyone who wishes to learn more about the risks associated with certain countries at certain time periods. \n",
    "\n",
    "As this is only a minimum viable product, the GRID lends itself to further and more nuanced development. For example, machine learning could be employed to display projections into the future for a given country, allowing investors to more accuratly predict the political and economic climate; datasets could be merged together to provide more detail and greater nuance as to political, economic, social, and environmental risk; or this model could be turned into an interactive website that produces full reports based on the user's inputs and preferences.
